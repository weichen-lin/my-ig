# KuShare

### For my personal instagram

The goal of this project is to integrate Google Drive and Instagram, providing users with a more convenient file management and social media experience.

## Infrastructure

Here's a brief overview of the tech stack that's used to build Reactive Resume.

- React (Next.js), as the frontend
- Golang, as the backend
- PostgreSQL, as the primary database
- Redis, mostly for caching
- Minio, an open-source S3 alternative to store objects

### Backend Structure
